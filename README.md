Philosophers is a 42-school project (https://www.42.fr/42-network/) which serves as an introduction to multithreading's basics.  

## Introduction

The dining philosophers problem is a classic example in computer science that illustrates the challenges of resource allocation and synchronization in a distributed system, using the metaphor of philosophers sharing chopsticks at a circular table. It was originally formulated in *1965 by Edsger Dijkstra*.
